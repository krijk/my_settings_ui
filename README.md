<br>

## Settings Section

The Setting section is the block of your settings tiles located in your `SettingsList`.

### Implementations

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| AbstractSettingsSection | An abstract entity. Just an OOP's thing (so you can expand it yourself) |
| CustomSettingsSection | You asked a lot. We implemented this for you. Now you can put anything you want as a child inside this custom section. Just paste the image of your cat or the weather widget inside the `SettingsList`. Feel free and enjoy |
| SettingsSection | The default section widget, contains `Widget title`, `EdgeInsetsDirectional margin` and the required list of `AbstractSettingsTile` we called `tiles` |

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Settings Tile

Here it is. The section tile. It displays the elements you want to show.

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| AbstractSettingsTile | One more OOP's thing (so you can expand it yourself) |
| CustomSettingsTile | The main idea is the same as for the `CustomSettingsSection`. You can put anything as a child inside your `SettingsSection`.
| SettingsTile | I think that we need to discuss this deeper. See below for the details.

<br>
<br>

### Settings tile

The implementation of `AbstractSettingsTile`. It has a lot of fabric methods and parameters. Let's
take a look.

| Constructor / Fabric method | Description |
|--|--|
| SettingsTile | Displays the default setting tile. Nothing special. |
| SettingsTile.navigation | Created to indicate this tile as a navigation tile. It adds a right-located arrow for the iOS design as an example.
| SettingsTile.switchTile | Creates a switch tile. Do you want some switch? Just use this one. |

<br>
<br>

#### Now let's deal with all these parameters.

| Parameter | Description |
|--|--|
| Widget leading | Adds some leading for your tile. Just like with the `ListTile`. |
| Widget trailing | Adds some trailing for your tile. Just like with the `ListTile`. |
| Widget title | The title of your tile.|
| Widget description | Additional info about this tile. Displays different ways according to the platform
| Function(BuildContext context) onPressed | More interactivity for your tiles. Just tap it.
| Color activeSwitchColor | Set the switch color for your `SettingsTile.switchTile`
| Widget value | Just like the `description` but more declarative. You can compare and choose which exactly you want to use.
| Function(bool value) onToggle | Override the on switch event in your `SettingsTile.switchTile`
| bool initialValue | Choose the initial value for your `SettingsTile.switchTile`
| bool enabled | Mark your tile as disabled. It's pretty easy!
